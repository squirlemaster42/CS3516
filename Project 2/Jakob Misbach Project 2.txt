1. The five layers are Frame 1, Ethernet II, Internet Protocol Version 4,
User Diagram Protocol, and Domain Name System.
2. The data-link layer protocol is Ethernet II.
3. The network-layer protocol is Internet Protocol Verison 4.
4. The transport-layer protocols are User Diagram Protocol, and Transmission Control
Protocol.
5. The application-layer protocols are Domain Name System, and
Simple Mail Transfer Protocol.
6. There are five layers because the internet model is being used. Since we do not 
need things like encryption and compression, we do not need the presentation or session
layers. The role of the data-link layer is to provide a transfer of information to/from 
the physical layer, and provides needed synchronization, flow control and error control. 
The role of the network-layer to establish, manage and terminate connections. The role 
of the transport-layer is to provide a transfer of data between two end points. The role
of the application layer is to provide access to the other layers and facilitate gettings
data ready to be moved.
